# Developing Games (My Journey)

## Chapter 1: The Start
I've always loved playing games, whether that be video games, card games or board games, so when I started to learn how to code, I knew it was a dream of mine to a create fun, unique game. However, I had one main problem: I had no experience in creating a game. So I started with the basics, I coded a few simple games such as rock-paper-scissors, adventure choose-your-path story games and even started a minigames program (which I'll admit, I'm yet to finish) in replit, using python, as practice.
